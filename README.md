## Labs
This directory contains the reports to all the labs that were carried out as a part of the course. Most of the labs were performed using a proprietary software - "Clay Net". The software allowed us to orchestrate virtual machines, virtual routers and many other virtual network components as well as interconnect them in various topologies.

## Project 
This directory contains the files related to the project that was carried out as a part of the advanced computer networks course. We were required to design a network for paramount healthcare (Problem statement: 1). We implemented the the designed network in cisco packet tracer. The focus of the project was mainly on the design component and understanding the customers business and technical goals. A load balancing script was also created to simulate the load balancing acting using real systems.
